# Overview
This research paper presents a comparative analysis of hydrostatic pressure in cylindrical and rectangular water tanks using finite element analysis (FEA) in ANSYS. The study investigates how different tank geometries influence stress distribution and structural integrity under varying water depths.

## Key Objectives
- **Simulation Setup:** Utilized ANSYS to simulate hydrostatic pressure conditions inside cylindrical and rectangular water tanks.
- **Stress Distribution:** Analyzed and compared stress distribution patterns in both tank types under different water levels.
- **Structural Evaluation:** Assessed structural performance and safety factors to determine optimal tank geometry for specific applications.

## Methodology

### Geometry and Meshing
- Created 3D models of cylindrical and rectangular tanks in ANSYS DesignModeler.
- Generated structured meshes to ensure computational efficiency and accuracy.

### Material Properties
- Defined material properties of tank materials (e.g., steel, concrete) in ANSYS Mechanical.

### Boundary Conditions
- Applied hydrostatic pressure loads corresponding to different water depths.
- Implemented fixed supports and constraints to simulate tank installation conditions.

### Analysis and Results
- Conducted static structural analysis to evaluate stress, deformation, and safety factors.
- Compared results between cylindrical and rectangular tanks to identify advantages and limitations of each design.

## Discussion and Conclusion
- Discussed implications of findings on tank design, maintenance, and safety.
- Concluded with recommendations for optimizing tank geometry based on specific project requirements and environmental conditions.
